# Jupyters_Nocode_YolOpenpose
 YolOpenpose:
 
 Combination of Yolov3 and OpenPose.
 Hopefully the pose estimation inside each BB is better compared to a single-shot OpenPose.
 However, the computational time of the approach depends on number of detected people. Which is a huge loss in terms of efficiency
 
 Only Jupyters available, rest of the method will be uploaded anytime soon
